My first "true" anime that I watched back in Sec 1. I can't really remember how it went, but since it was the first I watched, I really enjoyed the plot and characters even though it would be considered quite stereotypical after having watched so many other anime series.

Since it's a harem anime, there's a lot of typical harem things you can find in this anime. Honestly, not a good recommendation to new watchers XD
